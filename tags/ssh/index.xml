I&amp;rsquo;ve made a conscious decision to use Linux as a host OS on occasion so that I can learn its ins and outs, which helps me solve problems for customers, makes me more productive in the cloud, helps me troubleshoot fiddly devices at home, etc.
But sometimes, I have a problem - I need to be able to access computers on the corporate network, and the RDP Gateway server I&amp;rsquo;ve been using doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be supported anymore.</description></item></channel></rss>
