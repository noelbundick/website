Package managers make this go away most of the time, but sometimes there are things you need installed at the OS level to build or run.
Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) is a great tool that can run your automated builds and offers Hosted Agents where there&amp;rsquo;s quite a bit of useful tooling already installed (check the Linux Dockerfile here).</description></item><item><title>Frankenetes! Serverless Kubernetes</title><link>/posts/frankenetes-serverless-kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/frankenetes-serverless-kubernetes/</guid><description>In a recent post, I showed how it was possible to run the Kubernetes control plane components on Azure Container Instances. The cloud moves fast, and there have been some great improvements to ACI in the last month. In keeping up with the times, I&amp;rsquo;ve upgraded Frankenetes from just a virtual control plane to a full-blown virtual cluster! Look out, hacks incoming!

I recently took the time to run through Kelsey Hightower&amp;rsquo;s Kubernetes the Hard Way, specifically, the Azure version by Ivan Fioravanti. In addition to learning a lot, it sparked some interesting ideas on my flight home&amp;hellip;
My thought was that these are just apps, processes, binaries that run with flags - boring. Boring is good!</description></item><item><title>Fun with Azure Container Instances</title><link>/posts/fun-with-azure-container-instances/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Aug 2017 17:32:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/fun-with-azure-container-instances/</guid><description>Fun with Azure Container Instances ðŸ”—Azure Container Instances were recently announced, making it easy for developers to spin up a container on-demand without having to provision and maintain a VM or a cluster. It&amp;rsquo;s been well received by the community, and there are already a ton of great resources to help you get started.
But that&amp;rsquo;s not what this post is about! ðŸ”—Truthfully, I can only sit through so many canned docker run nginx demos.</description></item></channel></rss>
