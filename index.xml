Package managers make this go away most of the time, but sometimes there are things you need installed at the OS level to build or run.
Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) is a great tool that can run your automated builds and offers Hosted Agents where there&amp;rsquo;s quite a bit of useful tooling already installed (check the Linux Dockerfile here).</description></item><item><title>Cross-compiling Kubernetes on Windows Subsystem for Linux</title><link>/posts/cross-compiling-kubernetes-on-windows-subsystem-for-linux/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/cross-compiling-kubernetes-on-windows-subsystem-for-linux/</guid><description>Over the last year, I&amp;rsquo;ve gone from Linux n00b to a growing level of competence. In large part, this is thanks to Windows Subsystem for Linux, where I could learn and take advantage of command line tooling without being completely lost in an unfamiliar ecosystem. It also gave me an easy way to exit vim!
That said, I&amp;rsquo;m always interested to push the limits on things. After Brian Ketelsen&amp;rsquo;s recent post about WSL metadata, and some good conversation on Twitter, I was reminded that I had cross-compiled Kubernetes for Windows under WSL a while back, and had never shared how to repeat this feat of nerdery for others.</description></item><item><title>Using OpenSSH Server as a Tunnel on Windows</title><link>/posts/using-openssh-server-as-a-tunnel-on-windows/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/using-openssh-server-as-a-tunnel-on-windows/</guid><description>Confession: Windows 10 is a great operating system, and it&amp;rsquo;s my primary both at work and at home, but I don&amp;rsquo;t always use Windows. I&amp;rsquo;ve made a conscious decision to use Linux as a host OS on occasion so that I can learn its ins and outs, which helps me solve problems for customers, makes me more productive in the cloud, helps me troubleshoot fiddly devices at home, etc.
But sometimes, I have a problem - I need to be able to access computers on the corporate network, and the RDP Gateway server I&amp;rsquo;ve been using doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be supported anymore.</description></item><item><title>Frankenetes!

This newfound flexibility brings new challenges, particularly with stateful workloads like databases. With the advent of container orchestrators, it&amp;rsquo;s no longer a safe assumption that the underlying data for your server is already directly connected to your host. Nodes fail and are dynamically scaled, but your app still needs its data.
Azure Service Fabric is a distributed systems platform that added support for containers a while back.</description></item><item><title>Using the Azure IoT DevKit with Linux</title><link>/posts/using-the-azure-iot-devkit-with-linux/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jan 2018 20:22:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/using-the-azure-iot-devkit-with-linux/</guid><description>For a while now, I&amp;rsquo;ve had an interest in playing with IoT devices to do interesting things. I consider myself a novice (at best) with electronic components, so I wanted an all-in-one unit to get started. I recently borrowed an Azure IoT DevKit, which has lots of interesting little sensors on board, and a lot of getting started resources.
More precisely, this is a MXChip AZ1366

I recently took the time to run through Kelsey Hightower&amp;rsquo;s Kubernetes the Hard Way, specifically, the Azure version by Ivan Fioravanti.

It&amp;rsquo;s been well received by the community, and there are already a ton of great resources to help you get started.

Introduction ðŸ”—When I joined my current team a few months back, one of the first pieces of advice I received was &amp;ldquo;Use the Azure Portal to look at things, but make all your changes with the CLI or an ARM template&amp;rdquo;. That has turned out to be great advice, and I now give the same advice to everyone who&amp;rsquo;s serious about becoming an Azure expert.</description></item><item><title>Importing Certificates to Key Vault</title><link>/posts/importing-certificates-to-key-vault/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jun 2017 16:19:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/importing-certificates-to-key-vault/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve found that creating a secure Service Fabric cluster can be a challenge - primarily because of the required interaction with Key Vault. In my Service Fabric Cluster Quickstart post, I shared how the latest Azure PowerShell updates make it much easier to get up and running.

Sounds pretty useful to me - it looks like it could make it easy for developers to take advantage of Kubernetes without having to dive in and learn all the internals up front. Or for those who are already familiar with k8s - it could save some keystrokes, which I&amp;rsquo;m all for.
With that in mind, I thought it might be useful to try it out myself, and capture my step-by-step instructions as a guide for anyone else who wants to try it out.</description></item><item><title>Using Postman with Azure REST APIs</title><link>/posts/using-postman-with-azure-rest-apis/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 May 2017 10:09:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/using-postman-with-azure-rest-apis/</guid><description>Azure has a plethora of APIs to interact with, and a lot of them have friendly wrappers via the Azure Portal, CLI or PowerShell cmdlets. But sometimes, I want to interact with services on a more detailed level, or try out newer API versions than the current tooling allows for.
Postman is an awesome tool for interacting directly with APIs. Unfortunately, dealing with authorization isn&amp;rsquo;t always straightforward.
